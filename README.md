# PSO-Sobel-ImageProcessing
This repository contains a project on edge detection in images using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm in combination with the Sobel operator. The objective is to improve the edge detection process by optimizing the Sobel operator's parameters through PSO, achieving better accuracy in detecting contours in digital images.
